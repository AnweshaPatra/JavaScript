1. var declarations are globally scoped, or function scoped, 
while let and const are blocks scoped. 

2. var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; 
let variables be updated but not re-declared; 
const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.

4. While var and let can be declared without being initialised, const must be initialized during declaration
